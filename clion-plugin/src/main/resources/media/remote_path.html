<h2>üìÅ Remote Path</h2>
<p>Remote path configuration specifies the path to the project on a server host.</p>
<p>
    <b>On the remote server</b> the path need to be synchronized with the project path on the client (local) by
    CLion's deployment.
    Please make sure that the SFTP configuration has a consistent <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/creating-a-remote-server-configuration.html">mapping of local project path to remote path</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The <code>localhost</code> server</b> don't need the synchronization.
