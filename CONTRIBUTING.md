##Want a new feature or change existing one?
* Create an issue with proposal and describe your idea 
* Wait for our feedback, it will be decided who is preparing the pull request: we may need your help or fix on our side

##Found a defect?

 * Actual and expected result *(what went wrong?)*

If you already have a PR with solution - link it with the created issue.
