# How to contribute to UTBot

## Want a new feature or change existing one?
* Create an issue with proposal and describe your idea 
* Wait for our feedback, it will be decided who is preparing the pull request: we may need your help or fix on our side

## Found a defect?

If not - create a new one containing:

 * Pre-Conditions *(some special prerequisites)*
 * Steps to reproduce *(to be on the same page)*
 * Actual and expected result *(what went wrong?)*

If you already have a PR with solution - link it with the created issue.
