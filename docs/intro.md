# Intro

## What is UnitTestBot C/C++

UnitTestBot C/C++ is a user-friendly wrapper over the enhanced [KLEE](http://klee.github.io/) symbolic execution engine.

The KLEE engine is built on top of the LLVM compiler infrastructure and can automatically generate inputs for C code 
unit testing. While it is a well-developed and maintained tool, it requires environment preparation, preprocessing, 
and afterwork.

UnitTestBot C/C++ automates all these stages and provides users with a step-by-step wizard UI. 

## Why to install both server and client

The KLEE engine requires using a specific toolchain: exact LLVM and GCC versions,
and a particular solver. The other version of the necessary utility may be installed on a user 
machine â€” it may cause a version conflict: one cannot use different LLVM or compiler versions in a one-machine configuration.

We implemented UnitTestBot C/C++ based on a client-server model: it is a separate server where UnitTestBot C/C++ 
deploys the necessary _toolchain_ and performs the _resource-consuming operations_. The 
server may be local or remote, if necessary.

## Make sure you can build your project

If you cannot build your own project, you will not be able to generate tests using UnitTestBot C/C++.

## Check the supported language features

Though KLEE is a mature project, it still supports not all the C language constructs. For UnitTestBot C/C++, we 
implemented several KLEE patches to support _floating point_ types, _input/output_ operations, and _inline 
assemblies_.

UnitTestBot C/C++ still has limited support for C++ features. Check supported [C](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/wiki/c-syntax) and [C++](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/wiki/cpp-syntax) syntax.
