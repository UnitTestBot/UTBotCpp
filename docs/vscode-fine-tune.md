# Fine-tune test generation

You have already configured some settings with the _UTBot: Quickstart_ wizard, and you may change them later. You 
can also adjust additional settings for your testing purposes.

Go to **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** and navigate to **Extensions** > **UnitTestBot**.
